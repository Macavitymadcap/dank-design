        It is a collection of reusable components that can be used to build
        any web application. The components are built using the Holy Trinity 
        of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The CSS is based on the
        <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
        framework, but it is not a complete implementation of Bootstrap. 
        To make interactivity a core feature of the frontend, the winning 
        combination of
        <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank">HTMX</a> and
        <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/" target="_blank">Alpine.js</a> is used
        throughout this website.

        The goal of this project is to provide a simple and easy to use
        pattern library that can be used to build any web application. It is
        not meant to be a complete design system, but rather a collection of
        common reusable components that can be used to build any web 
        application.
